I created a website to analyze climate metrics over time. This is Plotly Dash application that displays climate data over the past 60 years anywhere in the world. I was inspired to create this project as mean global temperatures have increased nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit in recent history, but it was hard to connect that to the changes in my local climate. The application highlights the change in mean temperature, snowfall, and days of frost year by year, which allows you to see the climate change in your area. I learned a lot about AWS as I used their EC2, DynamoDB, Route53, CloudWatch, and IAM services to make the website possible.
