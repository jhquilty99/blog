title: "Northern Virginia Monthly Conditions"

It was getting late in the winter, spring was just around the corner, but I wasn't sure if now was the right time to sow some seeds for the garden. I looked for resources online for when to sow different seeds and the Farmer's Almanac has a plant date for every seed and region imaginable. This let me know that a good time to sow most seeds, ie [last frost date](https://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-virginia-last-frost-date-map.php), was late April in Northern Virginia. However the Almanac did little to help me understand what the variations in temperatures, precipitation, or light could be for the plants. 

I set out to create my own visualization that would help uncover why I ought to sow certain seeds at different parts of the year in Northern Virginia. I found that Dulles International Airport, has been collecting local weather data for 20+ years, and that data was available through NOAA. I downloaded this data, and visualized the variations in Tableau. I settled on using a box and whisker plot since that summarizes the distribution of temperatures across a discrete x-axis (months) well. My results showed me that the Almanac is right to think that April is the last frost date for this region.
