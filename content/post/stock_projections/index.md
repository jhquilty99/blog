Let's say you have $1,000 and you'd like to invest in the stock market but you'd like to balance the risk and rewards between stocks and bonds in your portfolio. This Tableau visualization will allow you to evaluate the potential return on investment with a variable ratio of stock to bonds. The visualization shows the growth of your $1,000 in the 2008 recession or over the past two years (2018-2020) which is characterized as a growth period. Two ETFs have been chosen to represent Stocks and Bonds: QQQ and BND. The graph is a plot of the value of these investments and a mixture between them in 2008 and 2018.
