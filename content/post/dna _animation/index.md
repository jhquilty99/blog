I wanted to use my skills with Blender to try and piece together the puzzle of what is happening with DNA transcription. I used what I already knew about DNA transcription from my textbook in addition to other graphics I had found on the internet to come up with a storyboard for the animation. Then I looked at online resources for downloading biomolecules and came across https://www.rcsb.org/ which had resources for every biomolecule I needed. I stitched together the environment with these 3D files, rigged up the camera, and started computing the animation on my computer. I created my own material to represent molecules that had a shininess and emits light to give it that ethereal look. I think this style helps convey that proteins take up space and have a particular shape.
