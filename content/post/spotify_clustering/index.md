title: "Spotify Playlist Clustering Techniques"
---

Like so many other Spotify users I find myself dumping all of my favorite songs into one massive playlist. If only there were some way to automatically make cohesive playlists out of the 1000+ songs I like to hear on Spotify. Thats how I turned to data science to inform and automate my playlist creation.

In this project, I examined the different dimensions that were offered by Spotify's API. At first I did some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and made functions that would taken a given Spotify playlist and generate histograms of songs by decade and amplitude, as well as bar charts for breakdowns by artist and album. Then I discovered that Spotify's API offers a decomposition of any song into 12 abstract dimensions such as energy, danceabiltiy, and acousticness. I performed some correlation studies on the dimensions to see if they were sufficiently heteroskedastic (not correlated enough) to consider them truly distinct measures. Upon that confirmation, I was able to perform clustering methods like K-means and spectral clustering using the _sci-kit learn_ package in Python. I used 10 to be the number of distinct clusters or playlists that I wanted to be generated from the master list. By comparing the silhouette measure between these clustering techniques I could get a sense of how well they were able to partition groups of songs. I found that t-SNE provided the best classification quality being that it is able to transpose the dimensions into a higher non-linear space.

To graph the different clustering algorithms, I used PCA to turn the 12 dimensional song data into two dimensions that could be plotted on a computer screen. The graph below shows this in action, with the different colors representing distinctly different sections of songs. To make this framework for clustering songs usable, I created a function that takes in the number of clusters and the Spotify playlist you want to split apart, performs the clustering, and pushes those playlists to Spotify for your listening consumption.
