This repo contains the Hugo project files for my personal website. Feel free to fork this repo for new personal websites.

# Deployment

The website gets deployed to jhquilty99.github.io/blog/ upon a change to the main branch. This is accomplished by the workflow (.github/workflow/main.yaml).

To customize the URL, I purchased a domain from AWS, haydenquilty.com. I used Route53 to associate the haydenquilty.com DNS record with jhquilty99.github.io/blog/.

# Website Structure

The blog website links to two other of my projects. There repos can be found here.
